                    <p>An Immigrant, An Extrovert and a Software Engineer.<br> An Immigrant of
                        Sierra-Leone West Africa, I immigrated to the us in 2014 to learn and gain valuable life lessons
                        and skills. I studied Computer Science at the College of Dupage in chicago Illinois. Relocation
                        to Charlotte Nc preempted me from graduating. I've always had intense curiosity for technology
                        and i always wanted to indulged in that field of study. Road To Hire was a dream come true for
                        me as
                        i'm sure it is for others, It's a 6 months rigorous course in which one gets to study and
                        practice multiple coding languages such as Html, CSS and Javascipt. During my time in Road to
                        Hire, I've been able to work with teams and independently to build projects with the help of
                        Javascript libraries and frameworks like Node.js, Mysql and React.js such as an E-commerce
                        website that sells video games and consoles, A website that gives and updates information to the
                        public about human trafficking and highlights areas that a of high risks. We also built a
                        website using 3rd-party API's to inform the public about air pollution and had an active
                        functionality that'll tell the exact location and air quality of the current location at any
                        giving time. Several other websites and applications were build by me and my team, please check
                        out my projects page. </p>
